Open Data Press
===============

Open Data Press makes it easy to publish Open Data from data stored in your Google Spreadsheets.

It's easy to do!

1. **Create a spreadsheet in Google Drive.**  
Share, collaborate and refine your data as usual.
2. **Design a custom template in OpenDataPress.**  
Format your data the way you want it - any mark-up, any schema.
3. **Publish your Open Data.**  
Your published data is automatically updated whenever your Google Spreadsheet is changed.

OpenDataPress is a complete rebuild of EasyOpenData (the first incarnation). [Find out why...][2]

**Update:** Regrettably, I no longer have the time to devote to this project. IF you would like to take ownership please [get in touch][4].
